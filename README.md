ByteMe food ordering system.

I have made two classes Admin and Customer to deal with two type of the users of the platform. It is assumed that there is only one admin
and multiple Customers .... i have pre defined one Customer. Customer have their own Unique ID to login .... the one that is predefined is
2023105 TO LOGIN AS CUSTOMER
It is also assumed that the customer places order of items which are available
to keep track of availability of each item a boolean variable "avai" is maintained.

Every time a Customer checks out their order they are asked if they want to place order as VIP and pay extra.
